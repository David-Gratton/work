    <p>I was a currency and derivative trader for 10 years working in NA, EU, and Asia. I left banking to run a
        software studio and agency, where my company built and marketed software products for Microsoft, EA, Viacom,
        Mattel, Arc'teryx, and dozens more. I helped incubate Appnovation from my studio. It is now a $100 million
        dollar company and I sit on the board.</p>

    <p>Over the last 5 years I have been an independent product consultant.  As a product consultant, I take a
        somewhat unique approach in that I believe that "product marketing" needs to be a core product competency
        and should not sit under marketing. This is especially true for new and young companies.,</p>

    <p>Here are areas where <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgratton/">I have helped</a> others: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Defining an executable product strategy to align the company.</li>
        <li>Developing product roadmaps for internal and external use.</li>
        <li>Market positioning and core messaging.</li>
        <li>Leveling up product teams to improve predictability and quality of their work.</li>
        <li>Mentoring and coaching product teams for high performance. Performance = on time, to budget, at quality.</li>
        <li>Mentoring and coaching PMs to make product marketing and GTM plans a core competency in their craft. </li>
    </ul>
